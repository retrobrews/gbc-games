1.      Introduction
--------------------

        Carcatau Development is a Gameboy(tm) developing group consisting
        of two people, Anders Granlund (programmer)
        and Joona Pîhî (graphic artist).
        This game is freeware, meaning you can freely copy it to anyone
        you want and/or post it on the internet or any BBS as long as
        this textfile goes along with the binaries.



2.      Compatibility & legal stuff

        this game might do to any of your hardware or software you are using
        to store or play this game with.

        The game was developed using freeware DOS-based Gameboy emulators and
        is intended for use on any such emulator. Although the game has been
        tested to work fine on the real Gameboy and Super Gameboy, we cannot

3.      The game
----------------

        The game is a clone of the classic game of "Space Invaders". The goal
        is simple: just destory as many of the alien invaders to gain high
        scores.
        There are some bonuses to collect by shooting down alien UFO's giving
        you more firepower to kill the invaders more easily.

        Controlls:

        A or B button:  Shoot
        left/right:     Move the gun left/right


4.          The story:
---------------------- 

When the signal reached Earth, a signal from what seemed to be intelligent
life, many UFO enthusiasts were overwhelmed by happiness. This was the moment
some people had waited for in their whole life, the proof that would show
us that we are not alone in this universe!

However, the happiness lasted not very long. As soon as the alien fleet reached
earth they opened fire without warning or explanation. This action took us
by surprise and laid most of our defences to waste. There are only a few
ships left to defend Earth agains the huge alien attack fleet.

Are you ready to fight for the survival of planet Earth?
