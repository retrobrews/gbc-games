Brickster for Game Boy Color
1st January 26, 2012 by rv6502

I made this little game in 1999 as a first step into Game Boy Color programming.
This homebrew game was released for free (as in beer) at a competition organized by Bung (a flash cartridge maker) who wanted to demonstrate the purpose of their products 
to indie game developers.
The game is free to download, copy, distribute and play in its unmodified form.
You may include the ROM as part of any software packages and/or devices (including commercially sold ones) as long as the source is not misrepresented.
