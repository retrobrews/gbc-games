Manic Miner

In each of the twenty caverns, each one screen in size, are several flashing objects, which the player must collect before Willy's oxygen supply runs out. 
Once the player has collected the objects in one cavern, they must then go to the now-flashing portal, which will take them to the next cavern. 
The player must avoid enemies, which move along predefined paths at constant speeds.
Willy can also be killed by falling too far, so players must time the precision of jumps and other movements to prevent such falls or collisions with the enemies.

Manic Miner is a platform video game originally written for the ZX Spectrum by Matthew Smith and released by Bug-Byte in 1983 (later re-released by Software Projects). 
It is the first game in the Miner Willy series and among the early titles in the platform game genre. The game itself was inspired by the Atari 8-bit family game Miner 2049er.
It has since been ported to numerous home computers, video game consoles and mobile phones.
