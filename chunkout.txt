Gameboy
Chunkout

I first developed Chunkout after playing SameGame on a friends computer and thinking how great it would be to have a copy on a portable console like the Gameboy Colour. I had been playing around with development on the Gameboy and Gameboy Colour for around a year before this, but this gave me an excellent project to work on.

Around this time, Bung Enterprises Limited, a manufacturer of console backup and development devices in Hong Kong, was running competitions for homebrew gameboy colour games to increase the popularity, and perhaps legitimacy of their products. Discovering this competition, I worked on Chunkout with this competition in mind, and tried to make as tight and complete a game as I could. While I didn’t take out any of the top cash prizes on offer, I did win a rather large (for the time!) 64Mbit flash card and two ‘voice cards’ that allowed recording and playback of voice samples on a gameboy.

In recent years I have contemplated producing a limited production run of carts for the Gameboy Colour version of Chunkout however finding someone with the time and know-how to develop an appropriate circuit board has proven elusive.
