Tochi
Gameboy Color / 2000
Written in Z80 assembly language for a Gameboy Color homebrew competition, Tochi is a puzzle game in the vein of Sonic Team's Chu Chu Rocket.
Different colored Tochis must be directed to their appropriate home by placing arrows in their path.

One of Ben Hopkins' first full games, Tochi also lead to his first job in the games industry working on Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance projects.

Recently rediscovered on an old hard drive, Tochi is now availible here for free download.
